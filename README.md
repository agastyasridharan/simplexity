# Simplexity

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/Astera-org/simplexity)

A library for exploring sequence prediction models from a Computational Mechanics perspective.

## Composite Mess3 Experiment

An extension of the Shai et al. (NeurIPS 2024) results to hierarchical HMMs. A slow-switching driver (dwell ~20 steps) selects between two Mess3 transducer variants. A 4-layer transformer trained on next-token prediction linearly encodes the full 6D Bayesian posterior in its residual stream (R²=0.982, MSE=0.004).

Key findings:
- Full belief state recovery confirmed by sequence-level cross-validation (1.00x) and shuffle control (54x)
- The network allocates deeper computation to the slower inference problem (driver R² grows from 0.56 at L0 to 0.89 at L3)
- Driver and transducer are encoded in significantly separated subspaces (z=-4.69 vs belief-projection null)

See [`docs/composite_mess3_experiment.md`](docs/composite_mess3_experiment.md) for the full writeup with worked examples and precise numerical results.

**Reproduce on Colab:** upload `notebooks/checkpoints/composite_mess3/` weights and run [`notebooks/colab/composite_mess3_experiment.ipynb`](notebooks/colab/composite_mess3_experiment.ipynb) using the load-checkpoint cell (~20 min, GPU required). To retrain from scratch, run the training cell instead (~1 hour on T4).

## Usage

### Installation

[Install UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

to include the dev dependencies, run:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

This should create a new python environment at `.venv` and install the dependencies.

### Training

Model training is configured using [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) with config files specified in the `simplexity/configs` directory. To train a model using the configuration specified in `simplexity/configs/train_model.yaml`, run:

```bash
uv run python simplexity/train_model.py
```

An experiment comprised of several runs can be executed to perform a hyperparameter search or otherwise run multiple trials with different parameters using [Optuna](https://optuna.org/). To run an experiment using the configuration specified in `simplexity/configs/experiment.yaml`, run:

```bash
uv run python simplexity/run_experiment.py --multirun
```

#### Advanced Training Metrics (PyTorch)

The `TrainingMetricTracker` under `simplexity.metrics.metric_tracker` keeps
instantaneous (current loss, learning rate, parameter/gradient norms) and
cumulative metrics (tokens processed, running average loss, distance from
initialization, cumulative parameter-update norms) in sync with a PyTorch
optimizer. The tracker is wired into
`simplexity.training.train_pytorch_model.train`, but it can also be used directly
when writing custom training loops:

```python
import torch
from simplexity.metrics.metric_tracker import MetricTracker

model = build_model()
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=3e-4)
lr_schedule = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, T_max=10_000)
tracker = MetricTracker(
    model,
    optimizer,
    metric_kwargs={
        "lr_schedule": lr_schedule,
    },
)

for step, batch in enumerate(train_loader, start=1):
    logits = model(batch["inputs"])
    loss = criterion(logits, batch["labels"])

    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    lr_schedule.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)

    tracker.step(
        step=step,
        loss=loss,
        tokens_in_batch=int(batch["labels"].numel()),
    )
    metrics = tracker.get_metrics()
    logger.log_metrics(step, metrics)
```

Each call returns a flat dictionary with keys such as `step/tokens`, `cum/tokens`,
`loss/step`, `loss/ma`, `lr/step`, `grads/l2_norm/step`, `params/update_l2_norm/cum`,
and `params/distance_from_init`, ready to be sent to any `Logger` implementation.
### Model Checkpointing

The `ModelPersister` class is responsible for saving and loading model checkpoints. The `LocalPersister` class saves checkpoints to the local file system, while the `S3Persister` class saves checkpoints to an S3 bucket.

#### Using S3 Storage

The `S3Persister`, can be configured using an `.ini` file, which should have the following structure:

```ini
[aws]
profile_name = default

[s3]
bucket = your_s3_bucket_name
prefix = your_s3_prefix
```

[AWS configuration and credential files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) can be used for authentication and settings. Authentication credentials should be specified in `~/.aws/credentials`. Settings like `region`, `output`, `endpoint_url` should be specified in `~/.aws/config`. Multiple different profiles can be defined and the specific profile to use can be specified in the `aws` section of the `.ini` file.
